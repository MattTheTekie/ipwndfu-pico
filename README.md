# Everyone's favourite open-source jailbreaking tool for many iOS devices ported for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

**ipwnDFU for the Raspberry Pi Pico.**</br>
The image comes from Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit for Mac. A5 devices only.

**Notes:**
I'm not sure if this will only put the device into pwned DFU mode, or if it will do that but in a way that only takes input from the Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit for Mac software. I was able to archive the Raspberry Pi Pico payload from a Reddit post. You can find how to use the payload from the links below.
