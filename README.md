# Open-source jailbreaking tool for many iOS devices for Raspberry Pi Pico.

ipwnDFU for the Raspberry Pi Pico. The image comes from Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit for Mac. A5 devices only.

I'm not sure if this will only put the device into pwned DFU mode, or if it will do that but in a way that only takes input from the Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit for Mac software. I was able to archive the pi pico payload from a Reddit post. You can find how to use the payload from the links below.
